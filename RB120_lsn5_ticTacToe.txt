Text File description of tic tac toe game.

A text prompt provides an option to user to quit or begin game.
If "begin game" is chosen, a game is initialized.
  An initialized game is comprised of empty board of nine fields, organized in a 3 x 3 grid, 
  and two players who take alternating turns placing marks to claim a field of the grid.
  One player is always the user, the second player can be either the computer or another user.
  The goal of a player is to mark three contiguous fields in a straight line, 
  and to block the opposing player from doing so. 
  Fields are marked turn by turn until a player wins or all fields are marked without a winner, 
  thus a tie.
Once a game is resolved, the user is offered a choice to quit or to play again.
